The rect() method creates a path for a rectangle at position (x, y) with a size that is determined by width and height. Those four points are connected by straight lines and the sub-\/path is marked as closed, so that you can fill or stroke this rectangle. 
\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}
{\em x} & The x axis of the coordinate for the rectangle starting point. \\
\hline
{\em y} & The y axis of the coordinate for the rectangle starting point. \\
\hline
{\em width} & The rectangle\textquotesingle{}s width. \\
\hline
{\em height} & The rectangle\textquotesingle{}s height. \\
